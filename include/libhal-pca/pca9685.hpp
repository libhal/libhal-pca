/**
 * @brief pca9685 driver: 16 channel 12-bit PWM generator over I2C
 *
 * Some details about the device are:
 *
 * - 16 PWM channels
 * - Single frequency for every channel
 * - 12-bits resolution
 * - Min frequency is 24 Hz, max is 1526 Hz
 * - Supports i2c clock frequency up to 1 MHz
 *
 * USAGE:
 *
 *    static constexpr hal::byte address = 0b100'0000;
 *    hal::pca::pca9685 pca9685(i2c, address);
 *    auto pwm0 = pca9685.get_pwm_channel<0>();
 *    pwm0.frequency(1_kHz);
 *    pwm0.duty_cycle(0.25f);
 *
 * After creating the `pca9685` driver, it can be configured or have its
 * frequency updated. It defaults to ~200 Hz. In order to control individual PWM
 * channels, `get_pwm_channel<N>()` must be called with the channel number in
 * the template argument. A compile-time error will be issued if a port beyond
 * the 16 channels is requested. The returned pwm object internally references
 * the pca9685 object it came from. All pwm channel objects are invalidated if
 * their parent pca9685 driver is destroyed. It is important to ensure that
 * the lifetime of the pca9685 exceeds the lifetime of the pwm channel objects,
 * otherwise, using such object will result in undefined behavior.
